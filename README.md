Student Stress Analysis Project
Overview
This project explores various factors that might affect student stress levels. Utilizing a dataset of student responses, the analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between different variables such as sleep quality, headache frequency, academic performance, study load, extracurricular activities, and reported stress levels.

Dataset
The dataset includes responses from students on various aspects that could influence their stress levels. Key fields in the dataset include:

Sleep Quality
Headache Frequency
Academic Performance
Study Load
Extracurricular Activities
Stress Levels


Correlation Analysis Findings
The core of the project revolves around correlation analysis, which helps in understanding how different factors are associated with each other. Key findings from the analysis are:

Sleep Quality and Stress Levels: Positive correlation, suggesting a complex relationship where better sleep quality might be associated with higher stress levels.
Study Load and Stress Levels: Positive correlation, indicating that heavier study loads are often linked to increased stress levels.
Extracurricular Activities and Stress Levels: Positive correlation, hinting at a potential increase in stress with more extracurricular commitments.
Headaches and Stress Levels: Slightly negative correlation, implying that stress levels might not significantly influence the frequency of headaches.
Academic Performance and Stress Levels: Almost no correlation, suggesting that perceived academic success does not have a strong direct impact on stress levels.
Tools and Technologies
Python for data analysis
Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Visualizations
The repository includes visual representations like heatmaps to illustrate the correlations in the data, making it easier to understand the relationships between different factors.

Conclusion
The analysis reveals the multifaceted nature of student stress. While some findings align with common expectations (like the impact of study load), others offer new insights, especially the relationship between sleep quality and stress levels.
